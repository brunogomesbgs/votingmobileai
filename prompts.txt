Using react native, make an application with 2 flows: the first flow allows the user to post features and the second flow other users will evaluated those features by unitary vote. Using python with fast api, make an api to receive a post for a new feature and other api which will receives a post for voting the new feature. Make sure to save those inputs into a mysql database using pydantic validation and tortoise orm. Both api must to be asynchronous return a json and be resilient in case of error. This application should be containerized in a docker. Both front-end and back-end must to have unit test.
